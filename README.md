# Resistor-Network-Calculator-EEE121-final-exam
I developed this project as part of my Python Programming Data Structures and Algorithms course to analyze and simplify resistor networks represented as graphs. I used Python dictionary libraries, graph traversal, and sorting algorithm concepts from class to solve this.

# Key Features:
Milestone 1: Determines if two resistors are in series, parallel, or neither.

Milestone 2: Groups resistors into series/parallel clusters and calculates their equivalent resistances.

Milestone 3: Simplifies the entire network using only series and parallel reductions.

Implementation Details:
Built in Python using dictionaries for efficient resistor and node storage.

Applied sorting algorithms to organize resistor groups lexicographically.

Implemented graph traversal techniques to analyze connections and compute resistances.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of graph theory, algorithmic problem-solving, and efficient data structure usage in real-world applications.
